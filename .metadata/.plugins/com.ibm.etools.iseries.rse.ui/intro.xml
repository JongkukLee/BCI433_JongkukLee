<intro>
<description>
Welcome to the Remote System Explorer (RSE). The RSE provides an integrated development
environment for IBM i programmers. It allows you to work with your libraries, objects, members, jobs and IFS files, as well as
edit source members, compile programs and debug applications.
<br/><br/>
We recommend that you follow the steps below to quickly get started using the RSE.  This overview is meant to help you find
some of the key features of the RSE.  Each step also includes a link to additional information in the on-line help.  There are also
PDM to RSE and an SEU to LPEX transition guides available in the on-line help with more information on how to move from green
screen programming tools to the RSE.
<br/><br/>
The topics below assume you are in the Remote System Explorer perspective with the default Workbench layout.  Look in title bar for this Window to see which
perspective you currently have open.  If this is not the Remote System Explorer then select Window > Open Perspective > Other
and select the Remote System Explorer from the list.
<br/><br/>
You can click the help (?) button to view more information on each step in the on-line help.

<item title="Creating a Connection to Your IBM i server" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/cbegin.html" skip="true">
<description>
The first step in using the RSE is to create a connection to your IBM i server.<br/><br/>
1. Locate the Remote Systems view.  By default this is located on the left hand side of the Workbench.<br/>
2. Expand the <b>New Connection</b> entry in the tree, and then double-click <b>IBM i</b><br/>
3. Enter the TCP/IP <b>Host name</b> and a <b>Connection name</b> for this connection.  The Connection name can be any name you want to
associate with this connection and will appear in the Remote Systems view.  Click Finish.<br/>
4. Your connection now appears in the Remote Systems view.
<br/><br/>
When you expand your connection you will see entries under the connection that allow you to access different IBM i resources.  These entries
are called subsystems in the RSE (they are not related to IBM i job subsystems).  The Objects subsystem allows you to access and
work with your libraries, objects and members.

<item title="Managing your Library List" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/tmanagelist.html" skip="true">
<description>
Expand the <b>Library list</b> filter below the Objects subsystem to see the library list being used by the RSE
connection.  The library list for the RSE connection is set based on the job description that is associated with your
user profile.  You can customize the library list in one of two ways: using the pop-up menu actions for the library list or
using the Initial Library List property page for the subsystem.
<br/><br/>
Using the pop-up menu actions for the library list filter is equivalent to using the EDTLIBL CL command.  The changes you make are
only in effect until the RSE connection is disconnected.  Right-click on the Library List filter to run actions such as <b>Add Library
List Entry</b> and <b>Change Current Library</b>.  Right-click on any library under the library list filter to run actions to remove the
selected library from the library list or move the library up or down within the library list.
<br/><br/>
A more permanent solution for modifying your library list is to use the <b>Initial Library List</b> property page for the Objects subsystem.
Changes made here will always be added to the library list for the RSE connection (in addition to the libraries from the job description).
To set these; right-click on Objects and select Properties from the pop-up menu.  Select the Initial Library List page in the Properties
dialog.  Note: these changes only take effect the next time the RSE connection is connected.
<br/><br/>
Each RSE connection has its own library list.  If you are working on multiple projects which require different library lists, you can create a
connection with individual library list settings for each project.

<item title="Object Table view" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/ctable.html" skip="true">
<description>
The Remote Systems view shows your libraries, objects and members using a tree structure.  If you would prefer a table view similar to PDM then you can use
the <b>Object Table</b> view.  To use the table view you can right-click on a filter, library, or physical file in the Remote Systems view and select
<b>Show in Table</b> from the pop-up menu.  Alternatively you can use the <b>Work With</b> actions in the Object Table view's pull-down menu to select an
input for the table view (the pull-down menu is the upside down triangle in the top right corner of the view).
<br/><br/>
Once in the view you can right-click on any library, object or member and get the same pop-up menu actions as you would see in the Remote
Systems view.  Double-clicking on a library or physical file will display the contained objects or members in the table.  Double-clicking on a member will
open the member for editing in the Remote Systems LPEX Editor.
<br/><br/>
The view's pull down menu contains additional actions for showing all the information for objects and members (<b>Show Columns > All</b>), positioning to an item
in the table (alternatively you can just start typing in the table view and this dialog appears), printing and subsetting the list.  The command area at the bottom
of the view allows you to run CL commands and view the resulting messages.

<item title="Opening a member" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/teditrpg.html" skip="true">
<description>
You can open a member for editing by right-clicking on the member in the Remote Systems view and selecting
<b>Open With > Remote Systems LPEX Editor</b> from the pop-up menu.  This locks the member on the host and opens
it in the local Remote Systems LPEX Editor.  After you are done making changes you can save the member using either
the <b>File > Save</b> menu option or the Ctrl+s keyboard shortcut.  The locks on the member are released when you
close the editor.
<br/><br/>
If you know the exact library, file and member name for the member you want to open then you can also use the <b>Open Member</b> dialog
to enter the information instead of selecting the member in the Remote Systems view.  To open the Open Member dialog either right-click on the
Objects subsystem and select <b>Open Member</b> or use the Ctrl+Alt+q keyboard shortcut.
</description>
</item>

<item title="Compiling a Member" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/tcomprograms.html" skip="true">
<description>
You can invoke compiles from within the editor or using the pop-up menu actions on a member in the Remote Systems view.  While editing
a member within the Remote Systems LPEX Editor you will see a <b>Compile</b> menu in the Workbench menu bar.  This contains two cascading menus:
<b>Compile</b> and <b>Compile Prompt</b>.  Use the Compile Prompt menu if you wish to prompt the compile command before it runs.  Each of these
menus cascades to show the standard IBM compile commands associated with the member's source type.  You can also use the <b>Work with Compile
Commands</b> action to customize the compile commands or add your own.
<br/><br/>
The compile commands are submitted to batch on the server.  After the compile completes, the RSE will automatically download a list of all messages
issued by the compiler and display them in the <b>Error List</b> view.  Double-clicking on entries in this view will automatically position the
editor to the line causing the error and insert the error message into the editor.  Use the <b>Source > Remove Messages</b> action to clear all inserted
messages from the editor.

<item title="Running Your Program" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/crun.html" skip="true">
<description>
How you run your application depends on whether it is a batch or 5250 application.  For 5250 applications it is easiest to open a 5250 emulator
outside of the Workbench and run your program the way you normally would.  For batch programs you can right-click on the program in the
Remote Systems view and select either <b>Batch</b>, <b>Multi-Threaded</b> or <b>IBM i application in RSE job</b> from the <b>Run As</b> cascading menu.  The
Batch action runs your programming using SMBJOB from the RSE connection.  The Multi-Threaded action is only applicable to multi-threaded C/C++ applications.
The IBM i application in RSE job runs your program in the server job used by the RSE connection.  This can be useful if you want to call a program to perform
some job setup for the RSE connection, however you will not be able to use the RSE connection while the program is running.

<item title="Debugging Your Program" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/cdebugsession.html" skip="true">
<description>
There are many ways to launch your application for debugging with the Integrated i Debugger.  One of the easiest ways is to use Service
Entry Points.  A Service Entry Point can be thought of as a system wide breakpoint set on a program, service program, module, or procedure that is
specific to jobs running under your user profile.  Below are the steps for using Service Entry Points:
<br/><br/>
1.  In the Remote Systems view, select the program, service program, module or procedure that you want to debug.  You can find modules and procedures by
expanding program and service program objects in the Remote Systems view.<br/>
2.  Right-click and select <b>Debug (Service Entry) > Set Service Entry Point</b>.<br/>
3.  This sets the service entry point and adds it to the <b>IBM i Service Entry Points</b> view.  You can use this view later on to remove, disable, or
refresh the service entry point.<br/>
4.  Run your application.  You can start it using one of the RSE options described above, from an emulator, from a Web application, as a stored procedure, etc...<br/>
5.  When the program, service program, module or procedure that you set the service entry point on is called, the job will suspend and
the Integrated i Debugger will attach to the job.  This causes the Debug perspective to open.<br/>
6.  Inside of the Debug perspective, the <b>Debug view</b> in the top left corner shows all of your active debug jobs and the current call stack for each one that
is currently suspended.  You can use the icons in the toolbar for the Debug view to control the debugger or use the corresponding <b>Step</b> actions under
the Workbench's <b>Run</b> menu.<br/>
7.  To set a line breakpoint, select any executable line in the source, then right-click and select <b>Add Breakpoint</b> from the pop-up menu.  All
breakpoints are shown in the <b>Breakpoints</b> view.<br/>
8.  To view or change the value of a field, select the field in the source, then right-click and select <b>Monitor Expression</b> from the pop-up menu.  This
adds the field to the <b>Monitors</b> view.  As you step through your program, variables in the Monitors view will be automatically updated to show their
current values.
<br/><br/>
The RSE perspective stays active while you are in the Debug perspective.  All open perspectives are shown in the top right corner of the Workbench.  You can switch to
another open perspective by selecting it there (you may need to click on the >> symbol to see a complete list of open perspectives).  Alternatively you can use
the Ctrl+F8 shortcut key to toggle between open perspectives.

<item title="Using Filters" href="/com.ibm.etools.iseries.rse.doc/topics/cfilters.html" skip="true">
<description>
Working with large lists of objects or members in the RSE is not advisable for both practical (it is difficult to scroll through a list of hundreds of items) and
performance reasons.  This is why the RSE was designed with very powerful filtering capabilities.  The Objects subsystem allows you to create library,
object and member filters.  These are roughly equivalent to the PDM commands WRKLIBPDM, WRKOBJPDM and WRKMBRPDM.  When you create a filter you also give it a name
and it is saved under your connection.  This allows you to take a few minutes up front to define useful filters for your projects and then benefit from them
always being there.  To define a filter:
<br/><br/>
1.  Expand one of the <b>Work with libraries</b>, <b>Work with objects</b>, or <b>Work with members</b> entries under Objects or right-click on Objects and select one of the filter options from the cascading New menu.<br/>
2.  On the first page of the wizard enter the filtering criteria then click Next.<br/>
3.  On the second page of the wizard give the filter a meaningful name (this name is what appears in the Remote Systems view).<br/>
4.  Expand your filter in the Remote Systems view to see the results, or right-click on the filter and select <b>Show in Table</b>.
<br/><br/>
Filters are actually made up of one or more filter strings.  When you first create the filter, the wizard prompts you for the filtering criteria for only
one filter string.  After the filter is created you can right-click on it and select <b>Change</b> from the pop-up menu to modify the filter string or
add additional filter strings.  This flexibility allows you to create filters that capture only the objects or members you are interested in using either
naming patterns (if possible) or explicitly listing each one.

<item title="Tips" skip="true">
<description>
Below are some miscellaneous tips to help you get started using the RSE:
<br/><br/>
1.  As a general rule, if you want to perform an action against something in the RSE or debugger then right-click on it and look for the action
in the pop-up menu.  For example, if you need to search a list of members for a specific string then multi-select the members, right-click and select
<b>Find String</b> from the pop-up menu.<br/>
2.  Most of the standard workstation shortcut keys also work within the Workbench.  For example; Ctrl+Home or Ctrl+End to go to the top or bottom of a view
or editor, Ctrl+c (copy), Ctrl+v (paste), Ctrl+z (undo), Ctrl+y (redo), Ctrl+s (save), using the arrow keys to navigate through a tree or table view, and positioning in
a tree or table view by just starting to type the name.<br/>
3.  Some additional shortcut keys to remember: Ctrl+F6 to switch between open editors, Ctrl+F7 to switch between open views, Ctrl+F8 to switch between open
perspectives, and Ctrl+Shift+a to open a remote member.<br/>
4.  Pressing F1 provides context sensitive help based on the currently active view.  Typically this help gives you a quick overview and some
hyperlinks into the online help.<br/>
5.  You can drag and drop views around within the Workbench window using the mouse, to customize the layout to your own liking.  Use the <b>Window > Reset
Perspective</b> if you want to get back to the default layout.<br/>
6.  Double-clicking on the title bar for a view or editor will maximize to take up the entire area of the Workbench.  Double-clicking on it again will minimize
it back to the original size.  The shortcut key for this is Ctrl+m (note this shortcut key does not work inside the Remote Systems LPEX Editor because that key
combination is assigned to a different action).
