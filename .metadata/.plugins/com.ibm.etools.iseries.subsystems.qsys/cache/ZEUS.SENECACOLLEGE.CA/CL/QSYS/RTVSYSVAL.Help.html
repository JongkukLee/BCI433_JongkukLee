<h3>System value (SYSVAL)</h3>
<p>Specifies the name of the system value whose value is retrieved and returned for use in the program.  The names and descriptions of the system values that can be specified are in the Work management topic collection in the IBM i Information Center at http://www.ibm.com/systems/i/infocenter/.
</p>
<p>This is a required parameter.
</p>
<p>The system values are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>QABNORMSW</b></dt>
<dd>Previous end of system indicator.  This value cannot be changed.
<ul>
<li>'0' means previous end was normal.
</li>
<li>'1' means previous end was abnormal.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>QACGLVL</b></dt>
<dd>Accounting level.  Changes made to this system value take effect for jobs started after the change is made.
<ul>
<li>*NONE  - No accounting information is written to a journal.
</li>
<li>*JOB   - Job resource use is written to a journal.
</li>
<li>*PRINT - Spooled and printer file resource use is written to a journal.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>QACTJOB</b></dt>
<dd>Initial number of active jobs for which storage is allocated.  Changes made to this system value take effect at the next IPL.
</dd>
<dt><b>QADLACTJ</b></dt>
<dd>Additional number of active jobs for which storage is allocated.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
</dd>
<dt><b>QADLSPLA</b></dt>
<dd>Additional storage for extending spooling control block (bytes).  The operating system no longer uses this system value.  Changes made to this system value have no effect.
</dd>
<dt><b>QADLTOTJ</b></dt>
<dd>Additional total number of jobs for which storage is allocated.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
</dd>
<dt><b>QALWJOBITP</b></dt>
<dd>Allow jobs to be interrupted.  This system value specifies how the system responds to user initiated requests to interrupt a job to run a user-defined exit program in that job.  The Call Job Interrupt Program (QWCJBITP) API in the IBM i Information Center at http://www.ibm.com/systems/i/infocenter/ contains information on using job interrupt exit programs.  The Change Job Interrupt Status (QWCCJITP) API in the IBM i Information Center at http://www.ibm.com/systems/i/infocenter/ contains information on retrieving and changing the interrupt status of a job.  The interrupt status of an active job can be changed at any time but will only take effect when the value of QALWJOBITP allows jobs to be interrupted.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.  The shipped value is 0.
<ul>
<li>0 means the system will not allow jobs to be interrupted to run user-defined exit programs.  All new jobs becoming active will default to be uninterruptible.  All active jobs are uninterruptible regardless of what the job interrupt status is set to.
</li>
<li>1 means the system will allow jobs to be interrupted to run user-defined exit programs.  All new jobs becoming active will default to be uninterruptible.
</li>
<li>2 means the system will allow jobs to be interrupted to run user-defined exit programs.  All new jobs becoming active will default to be interruptible.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>QALWOBJRST</b></dt>

<dd>Assistance level.  Indicates the Operational Assistant level of system displays for user profiles where ASTLVL(*SYSVAL) is specified.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
<ul>
<li>*BASIC    - The Operational Assistant user interface is used.
</li>
<li>*INTERMED - The system interface is used.
</li>
<li>*ADVANCED - The expert system interface is used.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a command does not have an *ADVANCED level interface, *INTERMED is used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>QATNPGM</b></dt>
<dd>Attention program.  If *ASSIST is specified for this system value, the Operational Assistant main menu is called when the user presses the Attention (Attn) key.  This value can be changed to the name of a program, which will be called when the user presses the Attn key in a job where ATNPGM(*SYSVAL) is specified in the user profile.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
</dd>
<dt><b>QAUDCTL</b></dt>
<dd>Audit control.  This system value contains the on and off switches for object and user action auditing.  This system value activates auditing on the system that is selected by the Change Object Auditing (CHGOBJAUD) and Change User Auditing (CHGUSRAUD) commands and the QAUDLVL and QAUDLVL2 system values.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
<ul>
<li>*NOTAVL - The user performing the command is not allowed to display the current auditing value.  You cannot change the system value to not available (*NOTAVL).
</li>
<li>*NONE   - No security auditing is done on the system.   This is the shipped value.
</li>
<li>*AUDLVL - The actions specified in the QAUDLVL and QAUDLVL2 system values will be logged to the security journal. Also actions specified by a user profile's action auditing values will be audited.  A user profile's action auditing values are set through the AUDLVL parameter on the CHGUSRAUD command.
</li>
<li>*OBJAUD - Actions against objects that have an object audit value other than *NONE will be audited.  An object's audit value is set through the Change Auditing Value (CHGAUD) command or the CHGOBJAUD command.
</li>
<li>*NOQTEMP - No auditing of most objects in QTEMP is done.  You must specify *NOQTEMP with either *OBJAUD or *AUDLVL.  You can not specify *NOQTEMP by itself.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>QAUDENDACN</b></dt>
<dd>Audit journal error action.  This system value specifies the action to be taken by the system if errors occur when an audit journal entry is being sent by the operating system to the security audit journal.  Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
<ul>
<li>*NOTAVL - The user performing the command is not allowed to display the current auditing value.  You cannot change the system value to not available (*NOTAVL).
</li>
<li>*NOTIFY - Notification of failure is sent to the QSYSOPR and QSYSMSG message queues, and then the action that caused the audit attempt continues.
</li>
<li>*PWRDWNSYS - The Power Down System (PWRDWNSYS) command is issued.  The system will then be brought up in a restricted state on the following IPL, and then only a user with audit (*AUDIT) and all object (*ALLOBJ) special authority can sign on the system.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>QAUDFRCLVL</b></dt>
<dd>Force audit journal.  This system value specifies the number of audit journal entries that can be written to the security auditing journal before the journal entry data is forced to auxiliary storage.
<ul>
<li>1 through 100.
</li>
<li>*SYS - The system determines when the journal entries are to be written to auxiliary storage based on internal system processing.  *SYS cannot be returned in a decimal variable, so the command returns 0 when the value *SYS is specified.
</li>
<li>*NOTAVL - The user performing the command is not allowed to display the current auditing value.  You cannot change the system value to not available (*NOTAVL).  *NOTAVL cannot be returned in a decimal variable, so the command returns -1 in place of *NOTAVL.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes made to this system value take effect immediately.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>QAUDLVL</b></dt>
<dd>Security auditing level.  Controls the level of action auditing on the system. Changes made to this system value take effect immediately for all jobs running on the system.
<ul>
<li>*NONE     - No security action auditing will occur on the system.  This is the shipped value.
</li>
<li>*AUDLVL2  - Both QAUDLVL and QAUDLVL2 system values will be used to determine the security actions to be audited.
<p><b>Note:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use the QAUDLVL2 system value exclusively, set the QAUDLVL system value to *AUDLVL2 and add your auditing values to the QAUDLVL2 system value.
</li>
<li>If you wish to use both system values you can set your values in the QAUDLVL system value along with the *AUDLVL2 value, then add any additional values to the QAUDLVL2 system value.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>*ATNEVT   - Attention events are audited.  Attention events are conditions that require further evaluation to determine the condition's security significance. For example, intrusion monitor events need to be examined to determine whether the condition is an intrusion or a false positive.

<h3>CL variable for returned value (RTNVAR)</h3>
<p>Specifies the name of the CL program variable that receives the value of the system value being returned.  The type and length for the CL variable when it was declared must be compatible with that of the system value being received.  The attributes of individual system values are described in the Work management topic collection in the IBM i Information Center at http://www.ibm.com/systems/i/infocenter/.
</p>
<p>In general, the return variable type must match the system value type.  For character system values that are 1 character long, the CL variable can be a character or logical variable.  For character and logical system values, the length of the CL variable must equal the length of the system value.  For decimal system values, the CL variable length must be greater than or equal to the length of the system value.
</p>
<p>The following table lists the type and length of each system value.
